The transaction table (csv) has a unique ID per transaction called the order_r_number. 



Each transaction has 2 records by default; a “Sales Order” transaction_type marking an order happened on the website, and a “Sales Invoice” type 
referring to an actually delivered and invoiced order. 


As the business partner is only curious about fully completed orders (i.e. delivered and invoiced),

you need to filter the data accordingly. In case a customer ordered more items in one transaction, each item appears in a new row under the same 
order_r_number ID. 

The item_code field refers to the ordered products and is a key for the items table. 



The item table (csv) includes product-related data using the item_code as a primary ID like the name of the product (model_name) or whether the product 
is shoes or apparel (item_category). It also includes an SKU field containing item model name, gender and item colour in a string. 



The google analytics table (json) is a nested table containing data on user behaviour on the website like the device on which the user 
visited the site (device), the marketing campaign the user clicked through the website (campaign) or the marketing channel the user arrived 
like email or paid display (channel_grouping). Inside the double nested fields of hits_transaction, the transactionId field refers to the transaction ID 
(order_r_number) of a purchase. The double nested fields of hits_social contains some information about the social media platforms users arrived to the 
site.
